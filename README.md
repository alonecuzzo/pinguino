## Installation Steps

2. Run `yarn start`

## Assumptions
- Limited zipcode to 5 numbers ranging from 0-9 assuming we only want US zipcodes.
- Since the the codebase is pretty small, I opted to use string literals for action types. In larger settings, it'd be better to abstract it out into a separate module.

- Clean up directories
